            <h2 class="top" id="proposal">High Concept</h2>
            <p id="proposal">The player must grow their own colonies to defend themselves and destroy their opponents.</p>
            <h2 id="proposal">Genre</h2>
            <p id="proposal">Action Strategy</p>
            <h2 id="proposal">Platform</h2>
            <p id="proposal">Universal</p>
            <h2 id="proposal">Story</h2>
            <p id="proposal">As a germ, the player must show their supremacy by defeating both the body they're invading and other germs.</p>
            <h2 id="proposal">Aesthetics</h2>
            <p id="proposal">A more abstract representation of the body and germs themselves are employed in this game, supported by ambient sound and light sound effects.</p>
            <h2 id="proposal">Gameplay</h2>
            <p id="proposal">Using the mouse or touch control, the player will grow their germs in colonies automatically, then send those germs to attack and capture other colonies, or attack the host. This simple control scheme will be taught in a tutorial that acts as the first level.</p>
            <h2 id="proposal">Screenshots</h2>

            <h2 id="proposal">Other</h2>
            <p id="proposal">I was trying to come up with a twist, because this is based on a browser game called phage wars. The best I've got is a different kind of opponent, the body, which sends phagocytes to attack both the player and computer-controlled germs.</p>
            <h2 id="proposal">About the Dev</h2>
            <p id="proposal">I'm Ryan Beach, a 2nd year Game Design &amp; Development Student at RIT. I enjoy thinking about and conceptualizing designs, and can code with C#, Java, html, and CSS. I am also familiar with Unity, Maya, and Photoshop.</p>
